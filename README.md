# Algorithm Analysis Based On Array Size
## Description
In this analysis, sorting algorithms are evaluated based on the size of the arrays being sorted. Both the number of comparisons and the runtime are calculated as average values. The study examines the average number of comparisons and the average runtime for sorting arrays of various sizes across multiple runs.

## Sorting Algorithms Implemented
-Selection Sort
-Insertion Sort
-Merge Sort
-Quick Sort
-Counting Sort2
